goal: "Create a web app that can detect moods, then can cheer up people, when bad moods occur. Moods that we are interested in are – Normal, Cheerful, Angry, Depressed."
work: "Created a web app where someone can speak to the app and the app will be able to detect that person’s mood. If angry the app will display a breathing exercise or if depressed the app will display a joke. I created the frontend design, implemented the backend that analyzed the users voice, and wrote up the README to get the project working locally."
